# Project Aim

This project is focused on the examination of different deep learning models, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), 
Long Short-term Memory Network (LSTM) and the Simple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with a spotlight on their effectiveness in evaluating sentiments through 
Customer review texts for the purpose of estimating business performance. 
By combining data from Trustpilot and an out of domain (OOD) dataset from Kaggle, the study investigates how well these models can classify sentiments into negative, neutral, 
and positive categories by measuring precision, recall and f1 scores.
